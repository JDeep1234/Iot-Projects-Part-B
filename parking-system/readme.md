# Smart Parking System

This project implements a Smart Parking system that utilizes IR sensors to detect the availability of parking slots. The system is managed using a Raspberry Pi and can be monitored through the MITM app, allowing users to check the status of parking slots in real-time.

## **IoT Design Methodology**

### **Step 1: Purpose & Requirements Specification**
- **Purpose**: To provide an efficient way to monitor parking space availability in real-time, reducing the time spent searching for parking.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use IR sensors to detect the presence or absence of vehicles in parking slots.
  - Use Raspberry Pi for data processing and communication.
  - Develop a user-friendly application using MITM for real-time parking status monitoring.

### **Step 2: Process Specification**
- Continuously monitor each parking slot using IR sensors.
- Send availability status to the MITM app.
- Allow users to check the availability of parking slots remotely.

### **Step 3: Domain Model Specification**
- **Actors**:
  - **User**: Wants to find available parking slots quickly.
  - **System**: Monitors parking slots and provides status updates.
- **Entities**:
  - **IR Sensors**: Detects vehicle presence in parking slots.
  - **Raspberry Pi**: Processes data from sensors and communicates with the app.
  - **MITM App**: Displays real-time parking availability.

### **Step 4: Information Model Specification**
- **Data**:
  - Slot Availability: Boolean (true/false).
  - Slot ID: Identifier for each parking slot.
  - Timestamp: When the status was last updated.

### **Step 5: Service Specifications**
- **Parking Monitoring Service**: Monitors the state of parking slots.
- **Data Communication Service**: Sends availability data to the MITM app.
- **User Interface Service**: Provides users access to parking slot statuses.

### **Step 6: IoT Level Specification**
- **IoT Level**: Level 2 (Sensing and Actuation).
- The system uses sensors to gather data and communicates the status to the app.

### **Step 7: Functional View Specification**
- **Functions**:
  - Read data from IR sensors.
  - Update parking slot availability status.
  - Send updates to the MITM app.

### **Step 8: Operational View Specification**
- **Operation**:
  - The Raspberry Pi reads the state of IR sensors at regular intervals.
  - If a vehicle is detected, the corresponding slot's status is updated to unavailable.
  - Availability data is sent to the MITM app for user access.

### **Step 9: Device & Component Integration**
- **Components**:
  - Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or later).
  - IR sensors (e.g., HC-SR501).
  - Jumper wires for connections.
  - Power supply for Raspberry Pi.
- **Integration**: All components are connected to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

### **Step 10: Application Development**
- **MITM App**: A user-friendly application for monitoring parking slot availability in real-time.

## **Installation Instructions**

### **Hardware Setup**
1. Connect the IR sensors to the Raspberry Pi:
   - VCC to 5V (or appropriate voltage).
   - GND to GND.
   - Output pin to any GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 17).

2. Repeat the connections for each additional IR sensor, ensuring each is connected to a different GPIO pin.

### **Software Setup**
1. **Install Raspbian OS**: Ensure you have the latest version of Raspbian installed on your Raspberry Pi.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Use the following commands to install necessary libraries.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-flask
# Setting Up Datastreams in Blynk for IR Sensors with ESP32

## 1. Create a Blynk Account and Project
- Go to the **[Blynk IoT platform](https://blynk.io/)**.
- Create an account or log in.
- Create a new project and name it (e.g., "IR Sensor Project").
- Select **ESP32** as your hardware.
- Copy the **Authentication Token** generated for the project.

## 2. Create Datastreams
- In the **Blynk Console**, select your project.
- Click on **"Datastreams"** in the sidebar or while editing a device.
- Select **"New Datastream"**.

## 3. Select Datastream Type
- Choose **Virtual Pin** to create datastreams for the IR sensors.

## 4. Configure Datastream for IR Sensor 1
- **Type**: Virtual Pin
- **Pin**: V4 (to match your code)
- **Label**: IR Sensor 1
- **Data Type**: Integer
- **Min/Max Values**: 0 (No object detected) to 1 (Object detected)
- **Widget**: LED or Indicator widget for visualizing IR sensor status.

## 5. Configure Datastream for IR Sensor 2
- **Type**: Virtual Pin
- **Pin**: V3 (to match your code)
- **Label**: IR Sensor 2
- **Data Type**: Integer
- **Min/Max Values**: 0 (No object detected) to 1 (Object detected)
- **Widget**: LED or Indicator widget for visualizing IR sensor status.

## 6. Configure Data Visualization in the Dashboard
- Go to your projectâ€™s **Dashboard** in the Blynk Console.
- Add a **LED Widget** to visualize the status of **IR Sensor 1**:
  - **Link** it to **Virtual Pin V4**.
  - Set the LED color as per your preference (e.g., Green for detection, Red for no detection).
  
- Add another **LED Widget** for **IR Sensor 2**:
  - **Link** it to **Virtual Pin V3**.

## 7. Deploy and Run the Project
- Make sure your ESP32 code includes the correct **BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN**, WiFi credentials, and virtual pins.
- Upload the code to your ESP32.
- Once the ESP32 is running, IR sensor readings will be sent to Blynk, and the LED widgets will indicate the sensor status in real time.
